## Allocation & Distribution

`SWX` token is introduced as a fair-launched token, designed as a deflationary token with a fixed total supply of 21,000,000 coins.

At launch, 119,364,000,000 `Nakamoto`, equivalent to 1,193.64 `SWX` or 0.0056% of the total supply, will be minted for network setup purposes. The remaining 20,998,806.36 `SWX`, or 99.9944% of the total supply, will be mined over a period of 100 years.

:::warning

With current chain configuration, after the mining block reward reaches 0 (at year 100), validators can still earn rewards by setting `minFeePerByte` to 0, which means transaction fees will be paid to validators. This can be achieved through on-chain configuration modification proposals, if the `fee` module on the Klayr SDK implements the `governance` module; otherwise, it would require a hard fork. For more details, visit the [Governance Section](./governance.md).
